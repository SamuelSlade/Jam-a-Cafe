Members in the group: Sam Umstead, Kayla Montague, and Ben Carrillo

Due to some partnership complications, I (Ben Carrillo) was working on the project by myself for a majority of the time until Sam
joined our group and helped me "finish" the website. Sam and I had no experience of coding before this class so our websites
foundation was somewhat lackluster. We wished that we would have had more time to study and understand how exactly coding a website works
before we went into making one. We focused too much on design and aesthetics and didnt realize the importance of functionality.
Because of this it was very hard to style and make responsive. We also did not know about the responsive view button and were designing
the responsive by sliding the tab to the left and slimming it down. We learned about the responsive view button in the firefox
developer tools a few days before.

RESOURCES

We used http://fontawesome.io/ for the social media icons and borrowed normalize css code from github. Some of our pictures were
gotten off of google and JAM'A Cafe's google page and some were taken ourselves.
